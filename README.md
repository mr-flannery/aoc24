- if every iteration has unique state => iterative
- if results can be reused => recursive + @cache
- maybe try going recursive first next time...
- go for the dumbest approach first
  - even if it fails for part2, it's a helpful first step
- thinking about theoretical complexity for a minute might be a good idea
  - e.g. I tried running a search for day 16, when e.g. Dijkstra is a better idea
